*I make absolutely no claims to the essay. This is just my modest work in progress to convert the original text document to Markdown. All credits and rights to "In the Beginning... was the Command Line" belong with [Neal Stephenson][1]. I acquired the text file used here from http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html*

I was introduced to this essay in or around 2004 in the form of a dog-eared paperback on loan from another developer where I worked. I had been dabbling with Linux for about 3 years by that point (mainly [Mandrake Linux][2]), dual-booting on a used Thinkpad I had purchased off Ebay. I made the leap not long after to the short-lived [Libranet.][3] Shelling out cash for an OS seemed like an ok thing, especially since I was new and still learning and having support sounded like a good idea. I wanted to support the project. In hindsight, it was a great distro for the time and the history of its decline and end is both a bit saddening and a testament to the rapid progress Linux as a whole made as an approachable OS.

Even though the loan of that original book was indefinite, I tore through it in a matter of a day. I reread it at least twice over the next few weeks. Eventually, I returned the book, but some of the ideas have stuck with me. I have to admit, I was not familiar with Neal Stephenson at the time. Having since read [Cryptonomicon][5] and [Anathem][6] (and starting [Snow Crash][7]), I was giddy to find that this essay, which had had an impact on me in my "formative years" as a Linux user, was available for download by the author. By his own reckoning, according to the [wikipedia][4] article on the essay, he considers much of the essay to be obsolete, having made his own move to MacOS X. I can't say I'm terribly surprised - perhaps a little disappointed, but not surprised. The ideas still have traction. You're welcome back anytime, Neal. :)
